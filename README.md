# Introduction

Hi, I'm **LisaY24**.

I'm interested in collaborating with Git users to learn secure web code. I'm a beginner at web development and looking to leverage my cyber security training to build strong, secure websites.  

I have experience creating SQL tables and writing SQL queries.  I am a Hyperion System Administrator with experience wrtiting maxL scripts, calculation scripts in Essbase, and overall managing Essbase cubes for optimized performance and functionality.
